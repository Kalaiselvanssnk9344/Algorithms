GFG: Peak element

IDEA
Idea lets us realize that the water trapped at any index depends on the minimum of the maximum height on its left and right.
Ex:
Water at index i = min(leftMax, rightMax) − height[i]
But calculating leftMax and rightMax for every index separately is slow.
THINK: Water depends on left max and right max

APPROACH
Approach lets us use two pointers to calculate water in one pass without extra space.
Steps thinking:
•	Start with two pointers: left and right
•	Maintain:
o	lMax → maximum height seen from left
o	rMax → maximum height seen from right
•	Always process the side with smaller max, because:
o	Smaller max decides the water level
How we decide:
•	If rMax <= lMax
→ water at right depends on rMax
•	Else
→ water at left depends on lMax
After calculating water:
•	Update the corresponding max
•	Move that pointer inward
THINK: Two pointers + smaller max decides water
